//! Keep backgrounded agent PTYs sized to the terminal so re-attaching after a
//! resize doesn't show a vt100 frame clipped to stale dimensions.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! wsx renders each agent through an in-memory `vt100::Parser`. A session's PTY
//! size is reconciled only in the *attached* render path
//! (`ui::attached::resize_pane`, run every frame). While a workspace is
//! detached (Dashboard) or a different workspace is attached, a terminal resize
//! never reaches a backgrounded session's PTY. On re-attach, `resize_pane`
//! calls `vt100::set_size`, which truncates and de-wraps the existing screen to
//! the new width (it does *not* reflow) — garbling the visible frame, and
//! permanently garbling the scrollback that the live repaint never redraws.
//!
//! Fix: on a (debounced) terminal resize, resize every *backgrounded* running
//! session's PTY to the projected single-pane size. Each session's agent then
//! repaints at the right width while detached, so the on-attach `resize_pane`
//! is a no-op and nothing gets clipped.
//!
//! This module holds the pure, clock-injected pieces; the wiring into the event
//! loop lives in `app.rs` and the per-session resize in `SessionManager`.
